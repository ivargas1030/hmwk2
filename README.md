# Profile
* In this assignment I have created the three files and attempted responsive design with bootstrap. I tried to follow the style shown in the photos. 
* I began with creating the three files and then began with the html. I took a lot of the HTML from my previous assignment. I added the bootstrap reference to the <head> section.
* Then I attempted the navbar, I could not get the menu to appear when the browser or viewing area is made smaller.
* I then worked on the content page and attempted to create the form.
* Finally I worked on the portfolio page. I added photos but I did not have time to attempt the padding.
* I took a lot of my code from the bootstrap website as well as W3 schools.

* Updated on 12/19, I added all the homeworks (even my not turend in weather app)and the group project at the bottom. I missed the LinkedIn and resume links. Right now I do not have a linkedIn.

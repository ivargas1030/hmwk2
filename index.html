                            <p style="background-color:white">My name is Iliana Vargas and I am from Chicago, IL. I am a graduate of the University of Illinois at Chicago and Northwestern. Currently I work at Northwestern University as a Financial Assistant in the Computer Science Department.</p>
                            <p style="background-color:white">Fun facts about me are that I am married and have a son. I have been married for ten years. My husband and I like to travel, we have been to ten countries together. This summer we are taking our son on his first international trip to Europe. Another fun fact is that I really like Hello Kitty and collect as many Hello Kitty items as I can. I was fortunate enough this year to visit the Hello Kitty Cafe in Irvine, California.</p>
